# Zoda

license: agpl

What's working now: 

- evaluation

- type checking (for Pi and Sigma types)

What I'm working on right now:

- Algebraic data types

Right now this "language" is just a toy, and I'll be happy if the only thing that happens from it is I get a good understanding of dependent types and other advanced functional programming concepts. However I do have an ambition for it one day to be a language uniquely suited for game development, which I find very fun but I don't like that I usually have to do it in boring languages like c#. I also would like to write a rust->zoda transpiler one day.
